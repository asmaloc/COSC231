		<h2>General Information</h2>
		<p>Greninja is the final evolution of the water starter in the Kalos region, Froakie. 
		Froakie and Frogadier are pure water types, but Greninja gains a secondary dark type. 
		Greninja is based on a frog; spiked protrusions above its eyes inspired by horned frogs, 
		coloration and body shape similar to splendid leaf frog, and bubble-like protrusions 
		referencing traditional myth of toads causing warts. Other frog Pokémon are the Poliwag 
		evolutionary lines and the Tympole evolutionary line. Greninja is also a based on a ninja. 
		Japan associates frogs and toads with ninjas based on the folk story "The Tale of the Gallant Jiraiya."
		The only other ninja Pokémon is Ninjask, a bug/flying duo type.</p>
		
		<h2>Strengths</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Greninja has the highest base speed of all Water-type Pokémon.</li>
			<li>Protean is Greninja's hidden ability. Before the Pokémon uses a move, it becomes a pure Pokémon of that type.</li>
			<li>Functions as a superb suicide lead, thanks to Spikes and Toxic Spikes and Protean Shadow Sneak.</li>
			<li>Greninja's movepool is vast, containing many types of attacks and status moves.</li>
			<li>Greninja will have a third possible ability, Battle Bond, which mega-evolves without using the item slot.</li>
			<li>The only Pokémon that can learn the protective fighting type move, Mat Block, is Greninja.</li>
			<li>Greninja can cover its type weaknesses with Gunk Shot, Extrasensory, Grass Knot, Ice Beam, and Dig.</li>

		</ul>
		
		<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Greninja has mediocre offensive stats and bulk.</li>
			<li>Darkrai outspeeds Greninja and puts it to sleep with Dark Void, preventing hazard setups.</li>
			<li>Pokémon with the ability Magic Bounce will bounce back entry hazards and beat it with attacks.</li>
			<li>Faster Pokémon that use the move Taunt can prevent Greninja from using hazards.</li>
			<li>Greninja is frail, so priority moves, such as Extreme Speed, are devastating.</li>
			<li>Bulky fighting and fairy type Pokémon can wall Greninja.</li>
			<li>Blast Burn.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Trivia</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Greninja is the ninth Pokémon to have been playable in Super Smash Bros. (Counting Squirtle, Ivysaur, and Charizard in Brawl as separate).</li>
			<li>It creates throwing stars out of compressed water. When it spins them and throws them at high speed, these stars can split metal in two.</li>
